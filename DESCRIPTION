Description: Includes the ga.lts() function that estimates
        LTS (Least Trimmed Squares) parameters using genetic algorithms
        and C-steps. ga.lts() constructs a genetic algorithm to form a
        basic subset and iterates C-steps as defined in Rousseeuw and
        van-Driessen (2006) to calculate the cost value of the LTS
        criterion. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression is known to
        be sensitive to outliers. A single outlying observation can
        change the values of estimated parameters. LTS is a resistant
        estimator even the number of outliers is up to half of the
        data. This package is for estimating the LTS parameters with
        lower bias and variance in a reasonable time. Version >=1.3 
        includes the function medmad for fast outlier detection in
        linear regression.
